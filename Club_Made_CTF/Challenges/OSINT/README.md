# OSINT

OSINT, or Open Source Intelegince, is the practice of finding information using
publically available tools. This can be trying to find the location of a photo
to seeing what vulnerability exists to exploit a service.
A list of really great tools can be found here: [Awesome OSINT](https://github.com/jivoi/awesome-osint). 
But at the end of the day, searching up what tools can be used can be helpful.
