# Password Cracking

Password Cracking, at its core, is the process of getting a hashed password, 
and using a variety of techniques to find what the original password was.
Usually a program called [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) is used, but sometimes other programs 
like [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) may be used for cracking things like zip files.
