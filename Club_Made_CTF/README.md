# Club Made CTF!

Here you can practice your skills with Common CTF Challenges made by Club Members!

## How it works

Each category contains problems ranging from easy to difficult, with the solutions 
being kept in the Solutions directory. As of yet there is not a way to keep track
of progress, but there will be somewhere you can soon! Flags will be in the format
of `UNRCyber{Insert_Text_Here}`

## Submitting your own challenges

Even if you are new, the best way to learn about a new topic is to dive right in
and make a challenge! If you wish to make a challenge, there are a few requirements:

1. A clear description of the goal
2. Title of the directory following the format: `{Name of Challenge} {Difficulty}`
3. A written solution guide in a text file with the same name as the challenge, 
feel free to go indepth as you wish, but try to refrain from just putting the answer 
down with no explanation.
4. Who made the challenge (Usually your name, but if from a 3rd party, their name)
5. if there is a flag, make the format `UNRCyber{Insert_Text_Here}`

Once you meet those, you can feel free to fork the repo and make a pull request with 
your challenge. If you don't know how to do this, feel free to read the git guide [here.](https://github.com/NevadaCyberClub/knowkedge-base/blob/master/Tutorials/git.md)
